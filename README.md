# open-soARce

## Welcome to the open soARce project. 

This project was created by Tiffany Madruga for the 2019 Media Studies Senior Seminar. 

Inspired by the hidden stories that exist everywhere throughout society and the film _Hidden Figures_, Tiffany wanted to incorporate this element of storytelling into existing textbooks by creating a web platform and corresponding demonstration to illustrate how stories could be added to textbooks to humanize the materials that students are learning. It began as a project to highlight underrepresented minorities in STEM, more specifically, women in computing and has grown to provide a platform to allow people to upload their own content to augment existing textbooks. The project, named Open SoARce, provides a prototype to show how a platform could be created to allow people around the world to share their existing stories by augmenting any image that they upload to the platform. It uses AR Technology (ARt for short) in the form of image, text, and web view augmentations to bring hidden figures to light.

# Why Augmented Reality?

Augmented reality is an extremely versatile medium that has been gaining popularity throughout this decade. It provides a unique way to bridge the gap between print and web media and well as an opportunity to mix reality with the digital world. There is so much information available to people online, but it becomes difficult to determine what to look into. Therefore, by allowing people to augment their lives and the objects around them, the hope of this project is to help people begin to realize just how much information is out there about things that they may not think twice about. In addition, this project hopes to introduce storytelling into an educational aspect, although theoretically, this platform could be used outside the realm of just textbooks.


# Tools

The Open SoARce is two-fold and contains both a web portion and a iOS application portion. The iOS application is called ARt representing the AR technology used to augment any textbook. In addition to the source code provided for these applications is a printed pdf that serves as an example textbook to use for experimentation and testing. 

The iOS application was created using Swift and ARKit following the following tutorials, both which have authorized for usage:

- [Augmented Card](https://github.com/vigetlabs/augmented-card)
- [Swift on Sundays - Spot the Scientist](https://github.com/twostraws/SwiftOnSundays/tree/master/014%20SpotTheScientist)

In addition, the web portion was created using Firebase, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. 


Note: In order to download and run this project, you will need to provide your own API keys to a database structured like the provided json file in the codebase. Since this a work in progress and demonstration for thesis, the API keys and podfiles have been omitted. You can run pod install in your terminal to generate the necessary podfiles. If you would like to run the application with the existing API keys, please contact Tiffany for more information.
